<p>Hello user, I am the proud owner of this group, my writer name is Pte Dubbs. I am a writer and the main web dev for this web page. I enjoy writing books, poetry, plays and many other writing based things. I also do some things with cars. If you want so see more about me, and/or see my youtube channel and my works, you can see my section on the <a href="creators.html">Creators Page</a>. Anyway, enough about me. Let's talk more about this group here. We were established with the goal of giving creators of litterary, cinimatical, and artistic inspirations a place to put all their work, and have a place for them to get feedback on their creations. If you would like to join this community it is free to join and there are no membership or hosting fees you need to pay. You can join the group and get your own personal section on our creators page by going to the <a href="BecomeAcreator.html">Become a creator page</a>. It may take some time to get a responce, but trust me you will get one. Thank you for taking the time to read our portfilio and if you have any friends aswell that need a platform for their content please be sure to show them our site. Thank you.</p>
